By colonket, last updated 2022-10-14

## So You Wanna Build a Web App?

A course I created for my partner to learn how to develop
web apps with Javascript, PHP, and MySQL. Also learning how to put
these apps into iOS and Android apps.

## Chapter 1 - An App for Users to Use

### About

Let's begin by building a web app using ReactJS

There are a variety of frameworks with which you can use JavaScript to
build web apps. One of the mostly commonly used frameworks is ReactJS

React is:
* Mostly developed by Facebook
* Lightweight
* Easier learning curve than other frameworks
* Lots of community support

    * This a great 12+ hour YouTube playlist by the channel JavaScript mastery.
    It walks you through how to develop clones of popular web applications using ReactJS.
    If you can complete this course, even if you're just writing down the code and following
    along, you will be proficient enough in ReactJS to be able to use the code you wrote as
    a reference in building any project you want with ReactJS.

### Outcomes

Students should be able to:

- [ ] Build a "Hello, World" webpage in ReactJS
    - Running ReactJS
    - Being familiar with your development environment

- [ ] Build a To Do List in ReactJS
    - Receiving user input
    - Showing input data

- [ ] Build a Calculator in ReactJS
    - Creating a user interface
    - Programming the logic of a calculator
    - Returning program output

- [ ] (Challenge) Build a TikTok Clone in ReactJS
    - Recreating a popular app



## Chapter 2 - Where Do We Put Our Data?

### About 

We can use our web app to give our users something to interact with.
Currently, any data we give the user has to be written into our code,
and any data we get from the user is lost when the user exits our app.

What happens when we want to hold onto data while our user is gone?
What if we want to store data for other users to see or use?

MySQL is a Database Server will store our user's information to be
accessed whenever by whatever application can talk to it.

In this chapter, we will set up a MySQL database and learn how to store
and search for data in the database

### Outcomes

Students should be able to:
- [ ] Create and host a MySQL database
    - What is this MySQL thing that we keep using?

- [ ] Use MySQL shell to insert, remove, and modify tables
    - How do we put data in the database?

- [ ] Look for data using MySQl queries
    - How do we obtain the data we want?

- [ ] Install PHPMyAdmin to provide a graphical interface to
manage the MySQL database with
    - Setting up a popular, useful web interface to manage your MySQL database
    - Administering your database through a webpage instead of command line

### About

We have our app ready to ask the user for data.
We have our database set up and ready to serve and store data.

How do we get data from the database into the app?

### Outcomes

- [ ] Create a survey form with PHP, and the data can be stored in a
MySQL table
    - Using PHP to obtain data from User
    - Storing data in MySQL
